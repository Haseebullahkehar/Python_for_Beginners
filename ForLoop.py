"""
For Loop:
    The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence, which
could be a list, tuple, array, or string.

Examples:
"""
list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

for var_b in list:
    print(var_b)
    print(var_b)
# it will print every number two times.

list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
for var_a in list1:
    print(f'The value is: {var_a}')
# Using statement in loops, which will be printed everytime the loop iterates.


# Using For Loop for range:
for i in range(11):
    print(i)
# It will print eleven numbers starting from 0 to 10.


# Creating String List
namesList = ['Azhar','Shahid','Haseeb','Arayan','Fahad','Jawad','Qurban']
for name in namesList:
    print(name)
# All names will be printed.
